# IF687 Natural Interaction

# AI Rock, Paper, Scissors

A web-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game that uses a webcam and a custom AI model to recognize hand gestures in real-time.

This project was developed for the **Introduction to Multimedia** course at **CIn/UFPE**. The goal was to build a web application using a model trained on Teachable Machine to identify live gestures and trigger in-game actions.

## How to Run

Simply open the `.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) and allow camera access when prompted.

## Important Instructions

For the best performance, please follow these rules:

> * Play against a **plain, solid-colored background** (white is ideal).
> * Make sure **only your hand** is visible to the camera when making a move.

## Model States

The AI model is trained to recognize four states: `Rock`, `Paper`, `Scissors`, and `Neutral` (the absence of a valid gesture).
